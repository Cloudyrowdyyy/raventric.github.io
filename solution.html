				To become lifelong learners, we need to know not just how to learn, but how to teach ourselves. 
				We must acquire the skills necessary to be independent, self-directed learners.  An information literate person should be able to: 
				<br/><br/>
				<b> IDENTIFY</b> information needs and determine the extent of information needed. 
				Clearly and concisely define the question to be answered, and realize that the question may evolve.
				Locate and retrieve appropriate sources of information. 
				<br/><br/>
				<b>UNDERSTAND</b> the structure of information: how is it produced, disseminated, organized, cataloged, stored,
				and retrieved, and how these factors vary by discipline.  For example, how do scholars or professionals keep up to date in and contribute to their field.
				<br/><br/>
				*Use indexes and other search tools effectively and efficiently to find specific resources 
				(e.g., select appropriate tools, formulate search strategies, use appropriate search techniques, evaluate results)
				<br/><br/>
				<b>EVALUATE</b> information and its sources critically.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>UNDERSTAND</b> different types of sources and formats, and how to use them.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>EVALUATE</b> the relevance and reliability of the information retrieved.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>SYNTHESIZE</b> the information retrieved, integrate it into one's current knowledge base, and successfully apply it to the original information need.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>DETERMINE</b> the audience's needs and the best presentation format; know the standards and criteria for presenting information in the relevant subject/field/discipline.
				<br/><br/>
				*Properly cite sources: direct the audience to sources of further information and acknowledge one's sources.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>TRANSLATE</b> these abilities and concepts to new projects and disciplines.

				<h1 align="center"> HOW TO VERIFY DATA: </h1>
			<p align="justify">
			<b>DATA VERIFICATION PROCESS</b>
			<br/><br/>
			Data verification is an activity related to checking and confirming information. 
			We apply data verification prior to data analyses, data visualisation, model training, model building and model validation. We use the verification process.
			<br/><br/>
			The verification process focuses on the following 4 aspects:
			<br/><br/>
			<b>Provenance: </b>is the data authentic?<br/>
			<b>Source: </b>who published the data, and where is it stored?<br/>
			<b>Date: </b>when was the data published?<br/>
			<b>Location: </b>from where is the data uploaded in case digital cameras or smart phones are used
			<br/><br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While addressing these items we triangulate and challenge the datasets and data collection methods, 
			for example by cross-checking similar or related datasets provided by other organisations shortly after a disaster took place,
			and then several weeks later. If the dataset indicates values without mentioning how those values were obtained, or what 
			definition was used for a particular parameter, or if unprocessed/raw data is required rather than aggregated data, 
			or if we simply cannot access the data for security reasons, we reach out to the content publisher or researcher for further details. 
			This ensures that we understand the dataset, its limitations, any ambiguity and its relevancy before we use the dataset in any of the subsequent steps.

				<h1 align="center"> BE AWARE OF FAKE NEWS </h1>
			<p align="justify">
			<b>Where Does Fake News Come From?</b>
			<br/><br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fake news is nothing new. But, what is new is how easy it's become to share information – both true and false – on a massive scale.
			Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn allow almost anyone to publish their thoughts or share stories to the world.
			The trouble is, most people don't check the source of the material that they view online before they share it,
			which can lead to fake news spreading quickly or even "going viral."
			<br/><br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it's become harder to identify the source of news stories, particularly on the internet, which can make it difficult to assess their accuracy.
			This has led to a flood of fake news. In fact, one study found that more than 25 percent of Americans visited a fake news website
			in a six-week period during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. But, not all fake news stories are found online. Co-workers who gossip by the water cooler and print publications that fail to check their facts,
			for example, are also guilty of spreading misinformation, even if inadvertently.
